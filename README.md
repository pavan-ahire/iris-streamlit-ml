# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning with Streamlit

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning application** that predicts the **species of an Iris flower** based on its physical measurements.  
The trained ML model is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interact with the model through a web interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most popular datasets in Machine Learning.  
In this project:

- A machine learning classification model is trained on the Iris dataset
- The model predicts the flower species:
  - Iris-setosa  
  - Iris-versicolor  
  - Iris-virginica
- The model is deployed as a **Streamlit web application**

Users can enter flower measurements and instantly see the predicted species.
